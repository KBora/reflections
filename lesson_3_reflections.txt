1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Collaboration with others, when you work on multiple machines, when you want a non-local copy of files
  
2 How do I push changes from local to GitHub repository?
  In the master branch (not sure if this is compulsory), git remote add origin <repository_url>
    'origin' is standard naming convention
  git push origin master
    This pushes the repository files to github. Will prompt for username and pwd if using https

3 What is a remote?
  Reference to another repository. When you clone a respository, a remote gets setup for your automatically
  
4 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you may be making changes locally and you dont want git to override the changes with an automatic pull

5 What is a fork?
	A fork is a copy of another repository on github - very similar to clone - except it only applies to github.  Doesn't require local download of the github repository .. the forked copy stays on github.

6 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    fork is a clone of another repository on github
    clone is a copy of another repository (locally or hosted somewhere)
    branches are labels for a sequence of commits
    use fork when you want to work on someone's github project
    clone when you want to create a new copy of a repository
    use branch when you need to make a moderate change to your code
